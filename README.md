# Node-Express-Chat-Application-With-Mongodb

This is another real-time chat application using Socket.io, Node.js, Express and Mongodb.

Socket.io gives us the way to have real-time 2 way communication between server and clients and this is done through a TCP socket

In order for anyone to clone this repository please follow the steps below:

> * **Before you begin, please make sure you have Mongodb installed and configured on your PC/MAC.**
> * **Create a new directory/folder and make sure you are inside this new directory/folder that you just created.**
> * **Git clone this repository into the new directory/folder.**
> * **Next, in your terminal run "npm install".**
> * **Before you run your application, make sure you have the mongodb server running in your terminal by typing "mongod".**
> * **Now, open up a second terminal tab and simply type "npm start" and hit "enter" to run the application.**

There is nothing fancy,the main goal was to learn the basics and to learn how to communicate between the server and the client and how to save data to a database(Mongodb)
